              Offering top-tier residential accommodations, our focus lies in engaging adults
              with Autism and Intellectual/ Multiple Disabilities through a diverse range of skill-enhancing endeavours.
              These encompass vocational training, nurturing personality growth, and honing independent living capabilities.
              In addition, we actively conduct awareness initiatives designed to educate the wider community about autism,
              fostering an environment of understanding and inclusion for individuals with autism and their families.
              Alfaa also provides respite and counselling for parents of children with autism and intellectual/ multiple disabilities.
              Alfaa also nurtures skill-building and awareness among students by providing internship opportunities to students from different educational institutions.
