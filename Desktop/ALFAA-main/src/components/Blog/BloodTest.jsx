staff members underwent
comprehensive blood tests to
monitor their health closely.
Following the tests, detailed reports
were distributed to parents, offering
valuable insights into their children's
health status. Based on these
assessments, personalized
medication schedules were
implemented to ensure each
student received optimal care.
Additionally, the school updated the
students' dietary provisions,
focusing on nutrition and health
requirements. This holistic approach
not only prioritized the students'
physical well-being but also
underscored ALFAA's commitment."
