two interns, Abhi Aju and Melissa
Andrew, who expressed deep
appreciation for their experience.
They shared gratitude for the

valuable lessons gained. The interns
received certificates of appreciation
and completion, marking the
culmination of their internship. The
farewell was poignant, with both
students and staff reflecting on
their time together, emphasizing the
bonds formed and the knowledge
exchanged during their tenure at
