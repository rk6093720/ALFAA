              The proposed day care residential campus would be developed on
              2.25 acres of land in the natural surrounding of north Bangalore,
              55 kilometers from Bangalore International airport near
              Chikkabatlapur (Giriapalli village near Mittemari). The
              neighboring villages would serve as pool of employable care givers
              and ancillary helper for the ALFAA campus. Thus we are committed
              to creating job opportunities for the rural people Living in
              nearby surrounding villages.

              story flats as living comforts for the hostlers. Apart from this,
              special care would be taken to have ample amount of lung space and
              walkways, play area and small tree grooves. The campus would have
              24X7 security and regular health care service would also be
              provided. The ALFAA Campus would cater exclusively for adults with
              Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and provide opportunity for self
